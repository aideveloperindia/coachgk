GOAL SETTING MASTERY - VIDEO 1
The Science of Goal Setting
Duration: 10-12 minutes

=== OPENING (0-30 seconds) ===
"Welcome to Goal Setting Mastery. I'm Gopikrishna Sarvepalli, and today we're going to learn the science behind why some people achieve their goals while others don't. The difference isn't motivation - it's methodology."

=== MAIN CONTENT (30 seconds - 8 minutes) ===
"Research shows that people who write down their goals are 42% more likely to achieve them. But there's more to it than just writing them down.

The SMART framework is just the beginning:
- Specific: What exactly do you want?
- Measurable: How will you know you've achieved it?
- Achievable: Is it realistic given your resources?
- Relevant: Does it align with your values?
- Time-bound: When will you achieve it?

But here's the secret most people miss: You need to connect your goals to your emotions. Why do you want this goal? How will achieving it make you feel? This emotional connection is what sustains motivation when the going gets tough."

=== PRACTICAL EXERCISE (8-10 minutes) ===
"Your assignment: Write down one goal you want to achieve in the next 90 days. Then write down why it matters to you. What will achieving this goal mean for your life? This emotional connection will fuel your persistence."

=== CLOSING (10-12 minutes) ===
"Goals without emotion are just wishes. Goals with emotion become reality. Connect your goals to your heart, and watch them come to life."
