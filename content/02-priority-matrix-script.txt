TIME MANAGEMENT MASTERCLASS - VIDEO 2
The Priority Matrix: Focus on What Matters
Duration: 8-10 minutes

=== OPENING (0-30 seconds) ===
"Welcome back to the Time Management Masterclass. Last week, you tracked your time. This week, we're going to use that data to create your priority matrix and focus on what truly matters."

=== MAIN CONTENT (30 seconds - 7 minutes) ===
"The Eisenhower Matrix divides all tasks into four categories:
1. Urgent and Important - Do these first
2. Important but Not Urgent - Schedule these
3. Urgent but Not Important - Delegate these
4. Neither Urgent nor Important - Eliminate these

Most people spend 80% of their time on urgent tasks, but the secret to success is focusing on Important but Not Urgent activities. These are your:
- Strategic planning
- Skill development
- Relationship building
- Health and wellness
- Long-term projects

I want you to take your time log from last week and categorize every activity. You'll be amazed at how much time you spend on urgent but unimportant tasks."

=== PRACTICAL EXERCISE (7-8 minutes) ===
"Right now, write down your top 10 tasks for tomorrow. Now categorize each one using the matrix. How many are truly important? How many are just urgent because you didn't plan ahead?"

=== CLOSING (8-10 minutes) ===
"Your assignment: Use the priority matrix for one week. Schedule your Important but Not Urgent tasks first, then fit in the urgent ones. You'll be amazed at the difference this makes!"
