TIME MANAGEMENT MASTERCLASS - VIDEO 1
The Time Audit: Know Where Your Time Goes
Duration: 8-10 minutes

=== OPENING (0-30 seconds) ===
"Welcome to the Time Management Masterclass. I'm Gopikrishna Sarvepalli, and today we're going to transform how you manage your most precious resource - time. But before we can manage time better, we need to understand where it's actually going."

=== MAIN CONTENT (30 seconds - 7 minutes) ===
"Most people think they know how they spend their time, but the reality is often surprising. I want you to do a simple exercise with me right now. Think about yesterday - how much time did you spend on:
- Email and messages?
- Social media?
- Meetings that could have been emails?
- Interruptions and distractions?

The average professional loses 2-3 hours daily to these time thieves. That's 10-15 hours per week - almost two full work days!

Here's what I want you to do this week:
1. Track every activity for 15-minute intervals
2. Note what you were doing and how you felt
3. Identify your peak energy times
4. Spot the patterns that drain your productivity

I've seen clients discover they spend 3 hours daily on email alone, or that their most productive hours are being wasted in unnecessary meetings."

=== ACTION STEPS (7-8 minutes) ===
"Your assignment this week: Keep a time log. Don't judge yourself, just observe. Next week, we'll analyze the data and create your personalized time management system."

=== CLOSING (8-10 minutes) ===
"Remember, you can't manage what you don't measure. Start tracking today, and I'll see you next week for the next lesson. Until then, make every minute count!"

=== VISUAL CUES ===
- Show a time tracking sheet
- Display a clock or timer
- Use graphics showing time wasters
- Include your contact information
