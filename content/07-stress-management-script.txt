"Stress is your body's way of preparing for challenge. The problem isn't stress itself; it's chronic, unmanaged stress that becomes harmful.

Here's the 4-7-8 breathing technique that can calm your nervous system in 60 seconds:
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 7 counts  
- Exhale for 8 counts

I've taught this technique to thousands of people, and the results are remarkable. One client used it before a crucial presentation and said it was the first time she felt calm and confident instead of anxious."
